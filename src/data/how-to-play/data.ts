    question: 'What is the objective of the game?',
    answer: 'The main objective is  to  guess a special 4-digit pin every day.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How is the game scored?',
    answer:
      'The game is scored based on three factors: the earlier in the day you guess the pin, the fewer tries you take, and the faster you guess, with bonuses for early and quick guesses, but penalties for multiple attempts and taking over 30 seconds.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How to win the game?',
    answer:
      'Your score, up to 1,000,000 points, is the sum of the three scoring factors. A new pin and challenge await you daily, so return each day to test your skills!',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you have any tips?',
    answer:
      'Use the ARROWS to determine if you should guess higher or lower. Start early for the biggest time of day bonus. Aim for a balance of speed and accuracyâ€”guess quickly but carefully. Remember, every 10 wrong guesses reduce your score, so think before you guess. Good luck, and have fun guessing the pin!',
